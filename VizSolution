Step 5: Creating a Scatter Plot to Visualize Customer Purchase Behavior

Drag the "Average Order Value" field from the data pane to the "Columns" shelf.
Drag the "Purchase Frequency" field from the data pane to the "Rows" shelf.
Click on the "Show Me" button and select the scatter plot icon.
Customize the plot by adding a title, labels, and colors.
